# FNVTerminalSolver

A solver application for the Fallout New Vegas terminal hacking minigame.

## Why?
Because the minigame is tedious, time-consuming and all the tools I found online weren't great to use. So I made my own!

## How to use
It's deployed live for you: go here: [FNVTerminalSolver](https://agreeable-mushroom-0345f5503.5.azurestaticapps.net/)

## How to run locally
1. Clone the repository
2. Install [.NET 8 SDK](https://dot.net)
3. Run `dotnet run` in the root of the project (the project, not the solution!)
